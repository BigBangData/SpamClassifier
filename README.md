# README

TODOs:
- write an actual README not a list of TODOs
- figure out a way to save preprocessed metadata
- study other ways to improve preprocessing
- train various models
- study models 
- recreate portions of or entire project in R: does R make one think differently about this? Are there performance issues?
- explore use case, is higher precision but lower recall always preferred
- why removing stop words increases precision but lowers recall? Is this always so?
- test other datasets
- test other use cases - can a great-performing classifier for spam also classify novels vs emails?
- invite collaborators
- make a nice presentation - center on a topic
