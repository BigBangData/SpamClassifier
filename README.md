TODO:
1. explore technical details (ex. sparse matrix)
2. explore use case - is higher precision but lower recall preferred?
3. why removing stop words increases precision but lowers recall? Is this always so?
4. test other datasets
5. invite collaborators
6. make a nice presentation

random thought - recreate a classifier in R!
